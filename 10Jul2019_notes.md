## The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software
Stuart Geiger

	- Number lines of code != amount of one's contribution to project
	- GitHub cannot capture/track all effort that goes into a project
	- I don't think giving disproportianatly more women the "glue" work (organizing, connecting) is unfair - we like it and we're naturally better at it! (#nonscientificstatement) That should be acknowledged. They should of course still get credit for it. That is the unfairness, but it should not be "solved" by artifically trying to gender balance it.

## Git "Hooked" on Images in your Version Control and Up you Documentation Game
Veronica Hanus

	- How to make a good commit message?
	- "If this is commit is applied, this will result"
	- Screen shot diffing 
	- There is a git for design (so can integrate images/screenshots with commit comments)

## Test Research Code the Easy Way: By Generating Random inputs with Hypothesis
Zac Hatfield-Dodds

	- Coverage tests: finds unexecuted (ie, untested) parts of your code


## A Geographers Journey into AI: Mapping Urban Trees from Scratch
Stefanie Lumnitz

	- Transfer learning: don't need thousands of training examples. It's a pre-trained model.

## Data Analysis Tools for the James Webb Space Telescope
Erik Tollerud

	- #vomit

## Using Nix for Repeatable Environments
Daniel Wheeler

	- Both a *language* and a *package manager*.
	- Can be used to create repeatable Python events
	- Currently state of environment influences outcome of installations. Sometimes inralling packages in different orders results in different versions of dependencies.
	- Package management really should be more like version control, with ability to revert to previous versions, etc.
	- Nix can generate visuals of dependency trees.
	- Nix installs each package in seperate site-pacakge directory.
	- Nix will run setup.py if available.
	- Pypi2Nix is especially for Python
