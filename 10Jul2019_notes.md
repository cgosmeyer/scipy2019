## The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software
- Stuart Geiger

	* Number lines of code != amount of one's contribution to project
	* GitHub cannot capture/track all effort that goes into a project
	* I don't think giving disproportianatly more women the "glue" work (organizing, connecting) is unfair - we like it and we're naturally better at it! (#nonscientificstatement) That should be acknowledged. They should of course still get credit for it. That is the unfairness, but it should not be "solved" by artifically trying to gender balance it.
